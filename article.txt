  Frxm fairest creatures we desire increase,
  Fhat thereby beauty's rose might never die,
  but as the riper should by time decease,
  his tender heir might bear his memory:
  but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
  feed'st thy lxght's flame with self-substantial fuel,
  making a famine where abundance lies fly until touch sky,
  thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
  thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
  and only herald to the gaudy spring,
  within thine own bud buriest thy content,
  and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
  pity the world, or else this glutton be,
  to eat the world's due, by the grave and thee,
  i should go to the Gym after this course .
